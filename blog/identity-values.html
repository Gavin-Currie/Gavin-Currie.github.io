    <h3>Identity and Values</h3>
    <div class="space">
        <br>
        <b>Describe your core personal values.</b>
        <br>My Values are:
        <br><u>Collaboration:</u>  Being part of a efficient and cohesive team. Where there is unity, there is a blessing.
        <br><u>Education:</u> Having the desire to keep learning. Having a curious spirit and be willing to be teachable.
        <br><u>Excellence:</u>  To pursue and own excellence and to give it your mark of authenticity.
        <br><u>Identity and Integrity:</u>  Knowing who you are, and what you do when you think no-ones' looking.
        <br><u>Innovation:</u>  To be an agent of change. Positive change that endures.
        <br><u>Truth:</u> To pursue truth, to be honest and authentic with yourself and others.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. 
        <br>Discuss how you weighed up the values involved with that decision you made and the consequences of of your action.</b>
        <br>While working for a company who had a culture of an unwillingness to teach new skills, or to listen to staff requests;
        <br>happy to let them stagnate in their worklife, was the catalyst for me returning to study. I learned after I left, other people who had left, 
        <br>have gone on into other industries and are thriving.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</b>
        <br>Being brought up in a Kiwi Christain household, have definitely shaped my values system and sence of identity.
        <br>Being made aware of values such as justice, mercy, compassion, forgiveness, patience, wisdom and a sence of right and wrong have made indelible impressions on my soul.
        <br>This has grounded my moral compass and defined my ethical boundaries, and the classical kiwi culture has given me a good sence of work ethics with the 'roll your sleeves up and get stuck in' ethos.
        <br>Sci-fi movies and cyberpunk books has definitely influenced my interpretation on what can be possible, through the use of emerging technology.
        <br>I think there is a generational culture also, that tends to influence your values and identity. As you grow up, you experience other cultures, rub shoulders with them, and little bits of who you are rub off on them,
        <br>little bits of who they are, rub off on you. Never-the-less, your version of the world will always be differentiated from others and so you tend to feel a little isolated: hence, the goldfish bowl effect.
        <br>It can be easy to slide off your path in life, if you let it. Sometimes you need to periscope above the sea of people, to see where you are going.
        <br>To make sure that this is the right path to be going down.
        <br>One of my biggest struggles is trying to convey what I'm interested in to others, but often it goes over their heads and their eyes go blank.
        <br>So I end up shutting down, and not say anything at all.  
        <br>Having good freinds with similar interests and value systems definietly helps with getting your bearings. A pit crew, to give an analogy.
        <br>Being aware that you are part of a bigger picture, and you have a part to play, gives me an honest perspective on myself.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development.</b>
        <br><u> Some of my strenghts:</u> 
        <br>Values driven and results oriented, and a willingness to be adaptable to any situation.
        <br>Analytical and curious, to find out how to improve the design or functionality.
        <br>Strong work ethic and sence of efficiency to ensure the job gets done.
        <br><u>Limitations:</u> 
        <br>I'm quite hard on myself regarding mistakes, and tend to get quite discouraged when things aren't going well, or as expected.
        <br>Im somewhat of an introvert. So being forthcoming and leading in activities, has always been a struggle.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Identify which of your strenghts might help you in your learning journey and how they intersect with learning obstacles.</b>
        <br>Having an analytical mind and a sence of curiousity will help with solving problems or suggesting alternate solutions.
        <br>I would wait until the full problem is conveyed, then work with them, to arrive at a solution together or suggest the best course
        <br>of action if options are discussed. Another thing I would do, is follow up with them later in regards to the option they went with, and the outcomes.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Share an example from your experience of where you trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension.
        <br>Discuss the strategies you used at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</b>
        <br>In one of my previous employments, I worked with a guy who had... issues. Very loud, abrupt, arrogant, stubborn, and wanted to be the boss of eveyone
        <br>even though he was an equal. I once had a disscussion relating to the topic of humility, and he'd never heard of the word. I was mildly shocked.
        <br>His behaviour grew worse until in the end, I just avoided him.
        <br>Eventually, he got so bad, he ended up getting fired two weeks later. 
        <br>The strategies I used at the time was to try and get them to see another perspective on things, but that didnt work. 
        <br> It made me feel stressed out and rarked up.
        <br>I think that when discussing topics of this nature, it's a good idea to have empathy and to come from that place of experiential knowledge
        <br>and it pays to have some knowledge on the personality type you're dealing with, to get an accurate gauge of the conversation.
        <br>From that experience, The strategy I would use for next time, with that personality type, is not to engage with them at that level.
        <br>Defer them to someone else.
