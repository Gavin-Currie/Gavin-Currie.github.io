            <h5>Dev Academy Handbook</h5>
            This week, I'm being more conscious of reading a bit - no, a LOT slower and reading more carefully in the right sequence, the instructions in order to get things working as expected.

            <h5>Wireframing</h5>
            I read this and thought: hmm, why not?
            <p>If I recall rightly, wireframing is a method of protoyping, or modelling which is essentially previewing a product, how it looks and interacts before you intend to release to the wild (your target audience).
            <br>A fancy digital version of sketching on a piece of paper. 
            <br>The app I'm using is: Mockup Pro from the microsoft store. It's pretty good.
            <br>So here's some wireframes I've done for my Web pages. Nothing's set in concrete, mind you, but I'll try to stick to what is intended as a final product.

            <h5>HTML and CSS setup</h5>
            ooh...I'm looking forward to this. I'm starting to pick up the pace a bit too, as it's all coming back to me. 
            <p>
                <br>...uh, oh.  
                <br>I'm wading in to the code now, and getting familiar with VScode. I'm looking at my old notes in OneNote regarding bootstrap, because bootstrap looks kinda cool. I'm doing wireframes to get an idea of how I want the site to look and function. <br>The vision grows larger...ideas start to flow. In the back of my mind, I hear faintly the song from U2, you know - the fly. where he says: ambition bites the nails of success. I start by copying and pasting old bootstrap 4 templates from OneNote, to see how we go. hmmm, kinda looks okay...I scrunch the browser up to mobile screen size: ...oooh, no.That dosen't work. I then go and have a look at bootstrap 5 online, to try installing the new version, and set up some test files to try and preserve what I have at the time, thinking: yeah, it'll be fine. I'll copy and paste. Six test files later, and two days go by. It looks like a burst toilet.
                <br>...UH, OH.
            </p>
            
            <p>Frustration starts to build. It's disintegrating before my eyes.
                <br>After looking at tutorials on how to load pages into a div, (because that how I want it to work), I copy jquery code into some test files, and after ditching the iframes becuase it was looking clunky and broke the page in mobile view, I decide to completely start again, and install bootstrap 5 - slowly. I begin rebuilding from the ashes...now, the jquery code to dictate the functionality of pages in the div. Finally, I tidy up all the CSS, and test. I scrunch up the browser - back and forth, and click to check.
                <br>Yus.finally.
