        <br>
        <h5>Overview</h5>
        Git and GitHub is a distributed version control system for managing files and file versions.
        It's a CLI based program that runs within Terminal (or command prompt), but but you can also use a GUI client version.    
        <br>(clients include: Tower, GitHub Desktop, Git Kraken among others...)

    <h5>Terminology:</h5>
    Some of the jargon, lingo and weird phrases used with Git...
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>repo:</b> This is short for repository, which is a directory both on your local hard drive and the remote site where your project files and folders are stored.
    <br>
    <br><b>clone:</b> The activity of copying a project from a remote site (namely GitHub) and downloading it to your local repo folder.The repo you clone, remains seperate and won't affect the repo you copied. 
    <br>
    <br><b>fork:</b> Essentially the same as cloning, but with forking - it's an activity that is unique to Github and only remains on GitHub. There is no fork command you can use on your local directory. However, you can clone that forked repo.
    <br>
    <br><b>branch:</b> A parallel timeline (or workspace) you can create, where your team can work on the same project files simultaneously without clashing.
    <br>
    <br><b>origin:</b>The name of your base timeline for your local repo (on your computer)
    <br>
    <br><b>main:</b> The name of your default base timeline that gets established when you create a repo on GitHub.

    <br>
    <br><b>How does Git and GitHub relate to each other?</b>
    <br>Git is where you produce all the files and folders for your project, and Github is the destination of where to send them.
    <br>Think of it this way: Git is your factory, and Github is your warehouse, or distribution centre.
    <br>
    <br><b>The end goal of Git:</b>
    <ul>
        <li>To create and develop project files.</li>
        <li>Refine the code within them and move them to the staging area.</li>
        <li>Get them from the staging area and/or to the remote repository as finished product.</li>
    </ul>
