    <h3>Learning Plan</h3>
    <div class="space">
        <br>
        <b>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</b>
        <br>To develop my skills as a front end developer, then to transition into full stack development.
        <br>To make a meaningful contribution as a useful member of a team involved with the design and development of innovative products and services within the IT industry.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</b> 
        <br>On topics that interest me, I have an initial strong focus and a desire to know more, and can retain this information well - however,
        <br>I tend to be distracted by trivial things that pop up during the pursuit of information which can impact my daily time management.
        <br>My limitations are my lack of awareness of doing the above, and the belief in my own abilities.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</b> 
        <br>Improve my conversation skills, an awareness and connection of others around me which in turn will help the above.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</b>
        <br>
        <b>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</b>  .
        <br>Having given up full time employment for this course, I amcommitting a more disciplined approach to time manangment and I have set up a designated workspace for study.
        <br>To be focussed on the task at hand until completion. When working with other learners, I will repsect their learning style and will engage focussed listening to facilitators and community representatives.
        <br>And when required, asking for feedback or clarity on instructions.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b> What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</b>
        <br>Step back, take a short break - maybe a short walk to unclutter the mind, and refocus. If still having difficulty, ask for help from a collaege.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</b>
        <br>By seeking someone who understands my situation and problem and know hows to provide an answer or can give me guidance to find the solution myself.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</b>
        <br>My expectation is, for them to check in regularly and give feedback on my work to date and  course direction.
