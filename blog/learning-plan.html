    <h3>Learning Plan</h3>
    <div class="space">
        <br>
        <h5>Foundations:</h5>
        <p>
            <b>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</b>
            <br>To develop my skills as a front end developer, then to transition into full stack development.
            <br>To make a meaningful contribution as a useful member of a team involved with the design and development of innovative products and services within the IT industry.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</b> 
            <br>On topics that interest me, I have an initial strong focus and a desire to know more, and can retain this information well - however,
            <br>I tend to be distracted by trivial things that pop up during the pursuit of information which can impact my daily time management.
            <br>My limitations are my lack of awareness of doing the above, and the belief in my own abilities.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</b> 
            <br>Improve my conversation skills, an awareness and connection of others around me which in turn will help the above.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</b>
            <b>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</b>  .
            <br>Having given up full time employment for this course, I am committing a more disciplined approach to time manangment and I have set up a designated workspace for study.
            <br>To be focussed on the task at hand until completion. When working with other learners, I will respect their learning style and will engage focussed listening to facilitators and community representatives.
            <br>And when required, asking for feedback or clarity on instructions.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b> What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</b>
            <br>Step back, take a short break - maybe a short walk to unclutter the mind, and refocus. If still having difficulty, ask for help from a collaege.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</b>
            <br>By seeking someone who understands my situation and problem and know hows to provide an answer or can give me guidance to find the solution myself.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</b>
            <br>My expectation is, for them to check in regularly and give feedback on my work to date and  course direction.
        </p>
        <p>
        <h5>Bootcamp:</h5>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>A description of what you hope to gain moving forward into the Bootcamp part of the course.</b>
            <br>My hope is that I will gain more skills in problem solving, develop better people/coding skills, participate in team collaboration, the ability to think laterally, maintain motivation  
            <br>and verbalise better, ideas that come to mind, and have the ability to back that up. To interact with others as if they were future employers, fellow employees or potential clients.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself during Bootcamp while at Dev Academy?</b> 
            <br>Again, improve my conversation skills, an awareness and connection of others around me which in turn will help the above.
        </p>
            <p>
            <b> What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</b>
            <br>Apply problem solving tactics that best suit the situation, then, take a step back, take a short break - maybe a short walk to unclutter the mind, and refocus. If still having difficulty, ask for help from a collaege, or my mentor.
        </p>
            <p>
            <b>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</b>
            <br>By asking my mentor or contacting someone on discord who understands my situation and problem and know hows to provide an answer or can give me guidance to find the solution myself.
