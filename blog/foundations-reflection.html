            <b>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself due to the core learning?</b>
            <br>That old habits die hard. Trying to get into the mindfulness and growth mindset frame of mind and applying neuroplasticity is tough to establish.
            <br>That I'm still easily distracted my on-demand chores and various to dos that need to be attended to and attention given to people throughout my day.
	    <br>Just how much of an introvert I really am, and how stubborn I can be when it comes to trying to learn something new.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</b> 
            <br>Being aware that the roles of values, empathy and self awareness are a holistic integration coupled with the cognitive deduction skills used in programming.
            <br>It brings balance to a person and how they interact with others and the world.
            <br>Without this sort of balance, you end up being a bit weird like me.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>What surprised you most about the core learning?</b> 
            <br>At first I thought it had nothing to do with programming, that everything was compartmentalised until I realised that it's the primary driver to how we think, not what we think.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</b>
            <br>Reaching out to others for help with the cognitive deduction part of things.
	    <br>Verbalising what I need to explain about problems I'm trying to solve.
        </p>
	<p>
Now that the foundations side of the course is wrapping up, I'm discovering that it's important to be mindful of the core learning and try to apply these values I've described in the values/identity page moving forward into the bootcamp phase of the course.
