    <h3>Sprint 4</h3>
    <div class="space">
        <br>
        <p>
            <h5>Neuroplasticity</h5>
            <p>I did a bit of a google search, and came across this article written in:<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01657/full#:~:text=Neuroplasticity%20can%20be%20viewed%20as,and%20in%20response%20to%20experience.">Frontiers.org</a> and how it discusses the brains ability to modify, change and adapt both structure and function
                <br>throughout life and in response to experience. Just as individual differences contribute to variability observed in brain structure and function mechanisms of neuroplasticity also show significant variablity across individuals.
            </p>
            <p>I'm doing a bit of paraphrasing here, but the article also discusses the structure of the neuroplastic brain in adults and recovering stroke victims.
                <br>With recovering stroke victims, they found it had the ability to dynamically re-route neural pathways to compensate for the lost pathways due to injury or damage, until the original pathways are restored to pre-damage conditon.
                <br> Another thing I'm coming across, is also the neuroplastic brain not only dynamically re-routes, it can also dynamically increase cognitive capacity on the fly.
                <br>Where some cortical sensory areas may be inhibited, other areas that manage other sensory functions are enhanced, (as evidence is found in optically challenged people, where their hearing is up to 50% more sensitve than sighted people.)
                <br>With adults who are learning a new skill or hobby, those pathways that were previously entropied or hardened due to inactivity, experience a "massaging" process at the electro-cellular level.

        <h5>Growth Minset</h5>
        <p>
            Again, I did a bit of research on the topic of growth minset and what that might look like. I came across a website with their list of how to develop a growth mindset.
            <br>(I've also added my own embelishments to this list, to en-enforce this to myself.)
            <ol>
                <li><b>Listen to the mindset voice inside of you:</b>There's a battle for your mind going on. Do you want the good to win?</li>
                <li><b>Recognise that you have a choice:</b> Free will and Wisdom from above, will decide destinies.</li>
                <li><b>Talk back with a growth mindset voice:</b> Your mind is a checkout conveyor, replace the negative by pushing in a postitive....beep.</li>
                <li><b>Practice:</b> As you keep practicing this, you will get better at it. Think of it as developing the minds muscle memory.</li>
                <li><b>Find outside help:</b>Finding a good mentor gets half the battle won, right there.</li>
                <li><b>Stop seeking approval of others:</b> You'll just become their slave...</li>
                <li><b>Replace the word "failing" with "learning"</b> Failing is an opportunity to re-route and improve your strategies as part of your success continuity plan.</li>
                <li><b>Take growth mindset action:</b> Now is good...Today is too.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        
        <h5>Code readability</h5>
        <p>
            This is something that I kind of knew about for a while, but it's good to have a refresher about the topic.
            <br>This discusses how your code can actually be cleaner and pleasant to read (from another coder's perspective) through the practice of:
            <ul>
                <img src="/img/code-indentation.png" height="340" width="600">
                <li>Having it all nice and indented. Indentation lines are your freind.</li>
                <li>Suitable and meaningful names for your variables and functions</li>
                <li>Consistent naming conventions</li>
                <li>the strategic placement of comments. (pseudocode)</li>
                <li>No syntax or logic errors.</li>
                <li>Good logic flow</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h5>Zen Garden</h5>
        <p>
            When I downloaded the repo for this, I had no idea what to expect. I was expecting something about bonsai's and pebble gardens with the little stones in a stack...
            <br>What I saw, was a dumpster fire of code with a burst toilet of html tags. Good thing my OCD instincts kicked in, and gave it a good going over and tidied it up.
            <br>That was a satisfying little exercise, if I say so myself.
        </p>
        <h5>Testing</h5>
        <p>
            This was actually a good topic to read about and start to get into the habit of testing how the pro's do it.
            <br>Testing as it discusses in this sprint, not only talks about actaully testing the code, but also writing code that TESTS the code.
            <br>And dicsussing the differences between unit testing (Which is breaking down the project into smaller bite sized blocks of code, or seperate independent functions, and testing them individually),
            <br>And TTD (<b>T</b>est <b>D</b>riven <b>D</b>evelopment) which is another testing methodology used get a big picture of the project and then start writing your test BEFORE you write the actual code.
            <br>In theory I had a grasp of it, but that took a while to get my head around, on how how to structure the tests because the tests were syntaxxed (is that a word?) differently to how you would actually code.
        </p>
        <h5>Repl.it</h5>
        <p>
            At first I was a bit reluctant to use this, as I'm a creature of habit. But after I signed up and started using it, I then thought: 'oh... ok. this is alright..'
            <br>It's a web browser based IDE (<b>I</b>ntegrated <b>D</b>evelopment <b>E</b>nvironment) where all your project files, your code section, and the ouput screen are all in one Browser window. Right out of the box.
            <br>Great for testing... well, your tests and code sandboxing experiements.
            <br><img src="/img/repl-screen.png" height="360" width="700">
            <br>AND you can clone your repl projects to github. Clever thinking.
        </p>
        <h5>JavaScript Methods</h5>
        <p>
            There were a series of tasks we had to do, where we had to research a couple of JavaScript methods and implement them into a couple of little programs that used them.
            <br>Here are my two methods I researched. That was fun doing that.
            <br><img src="/img/js-method.png" height="360" width="700">
        </p>
        <h5>Kata</h5>
        <p>
            Kata is a karate term which is the activity of doing small repetitive tasks to improve your form.
            <br>This is where we start to practise our JavaScript coding skills... I'm getting nervous. The following Kata's had us using repl.it as our testing environment
            <br>where each task that was required to complete, we cloned from github into our repl environment, and begin running the tests - to get our feet wet.
            <br>Judging by the amount of requests for help this week on discord from other students, this has stretched everyone's mind. Mine included.
