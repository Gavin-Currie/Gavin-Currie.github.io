    <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>
    <div class="space">
        <p> I did a bit of a google search, and came across this article written in:<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01657/full#:~:text=Neuroplasticity%20can%20be%20viewed%20as,and%20in%20response%20to%20experience.">Frontiers.org</a> and how it discusses the brains ability to modify, change and adapt both structure and function
            <br>throughout life and in response to experience. Just as individual differences contribute to variability observed in brain structure and function mechanisms of neuroplasticity also show significant variablity across individuals.
            <br>There may be subtle factors that show differences between age groups and gender and sensory experience that contribute to the broad variabilty of study results.
        </p>
        <p>I'm doing a bit of paraphrasing here, but the article also discusses the structure of the neuroplastic brain in adults and recovering stroke victims.
            <br>With recovering stroke victims, they found it had the ability to dynamically re-route neural pathways to compensate for the lost pathways due to injury or damage, until the original pathways are restored to pre-damage conditon.
            <br> Another thing I'm coming across, is also the neuroplastic brain not only dynamically re-routes, it can also dynamically increase cognitive capacity on the fly.
            <br>Where some cortical sensory areas may be inhibited, other areas that manage other sensory functions are enhanced, (as evidence is found in optically challenged people, where their hearing is up to 50% more sensitve than sighted people.)
            <br>With adults who are learning a new skill or hobby, those pathways that were previously hardened due to inactivity, experience a "massaging" process at the electro-cellular level.
            <br>(...whoa. this stuff is interesting.)
        </p>
        <p>It's making me think about the dynamic re-routing part. How the node pathways throughout the internet:
            <br><img src="/img/neural-network.png" height="260" width="450">
            <br>
            <br>Are modelled on the brains organic neural pathways:
            <br><img src="/img/neuron-brain.png" height="260" width="450">
            <br>The only difference is, the brain does it all automatically. The firmware comes out of the box pre-bundled. Once more, it runs a double shift: both transmitting and storing simultaneously.
            <br>It makes me think: someone's done a pretty good job.

            <b>Good neuroplastic health:</b>
            <br>Here is a list of some good fuel for that neuroplastic brain. The brain is an electro-chemical organ, too.
            <ul>
                <li><b>Berries:</b>A good source of anthocyanins</li>
                <li><b>Dark chocolate:</b> For a memory boost</li>
                <li><b>Nuts:</b> Protein</li>
                <li><b>Eggs:</b> B12, choline, selenium</li>
                <li><b>Avocados:</b> lutein</li>
                <li><b>Fish:</b> B12, selenium, Vitamin D</li>
                <li><b>Sunshine:</b> need I say more?...</li>
                <li><b>Water:</b> oxygen to the brain.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
        Again, I did a bit of research on the topic of growth minset and what that might look like. I came across the <a href="https://www.wgu.edu/blog/what-is-growth-mindset-8-steps-develop-one1904.html#close">Western Governors University</a> website with their list of how to develop a growth mindset.
        <br>(I've also added my own embelishments to this list, to en-enforce this to myself.)
        <br><ol>
            <li><b>Listen to the mindset voice inside of you:</b>There's a battle for your mind going on. Do you want the good to win?</li>
            <li><b>Recognise that you have a choice:</b> Free will and Wisdom from above, will decide destinies.</li>
            <li><b>Talk back with a growth mindset voice:</b> Your mind is a checkout conveyor, replace the negative by pushing in a postitive....beep.</li>
            <li><b>Practice:</b> As you keep practicing this, you will get better at it. Think of it as developing the minds muscle memory.</li>
            <li><b>Find outside help:</b>Finding a good mentor gets half the battle won, right there.</li>
            <li><b>Stop seeking approval of others:</b> You'll just become their slave...</li>
            <li><b>Replace the word "failing" with "learning"</b> Failing is an opportunity to re-route and improve your strategies as part of your success continuity plan.</li>
            <li><b>Take growth mindset action:</b> Now is good...Today is too.</li>
        </ol>
