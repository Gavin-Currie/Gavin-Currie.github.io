    <h3>Emotional Intelligence</h3>
    <div class="space">
        <br>hmmm... Emotional Intelligence - what is it?
        <br>How does this relate to EQ (Emotional Quotent) and IQ (Intelligence Quotent)?
        <br>I did a bit of research, and according to <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/eq-vs-iq">healthline.com</a> :
        <br>
        <br><b>IQ</b> refers to your intellectual ability. Some of the common elements include:
        <ul>
            <li>Use logic to solve problems.</li>
            <li>Plan and strategise.</li>
            <li>Understand abstract ideas.</li>
            <li>Learn and adapt to change.</li>
            <li>Grasp and use language.</li>
        </ul>
        <br><b>EQ</b> refers to your ability to sence emotion in yourself and others.(Sometimes interchanged with the phrase: Emotional intelligence) 
        <br>If you have high EQ, you may find it easy to:
        <ul>
            <li>Identify emotions in yourself and others.</li>
            <li>Empathise with other people.</li>
            <li>Adapt your feelings and behaviours to different situations.</li>
            <li>Control your impulses.</li>
            <li>Withstand temptation and delay gratification.</li>
            <li>Resolve conflicts with others.</li>
            <li>Communicate effectively.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h5>Testing:</h5>
        <b>IQ</b> tests typically measure two different intelligence abilities known as:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Crystalised intelligence:</b> which is based on your verbal ability and knowledge and usually improves as you get older.</li>
            <li><b>Fluid Intelligence:</b> This gives you the ability to think abstractly and solve problems without pre-existing knowledge</li>
        </ul>
        <br><b>EQ</b> tests on the other hand, rank your abilities in five areas:
        <ul>
            <li>Self awareness</li>
            <li>Self regulation</li>
            <li>Motivation</li>
            <li>Empathy</li>
            <li>Social skills</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h5>Practice of Emtional Intelligence</h5>
        Some ways to practice Emotional Intelligence:
        <ol>
            <li><b>The practice of mindfulness:</b> focussing on enhancing a sence of 'engaged: now' and compassion for ourselves and others, to be less reactive, and think about pre-emptive wisdom. Your own style of calm.</li>
            <li><b>Self knowledge and self mastery:</b> This includes being aware of our emotional buttons that get pushed in certain situations, and how to mitigate those reactions.</li>
            <li><b>Create useful mental habits:</b> To be on guard against those negative self-thoughts that creep into your mind from time to time.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>Creating good and useful habits takes discipline.
        <br>Discipline shapes and improves your character.
        <br>Your character shapes your lifestyle.
        <br>Your lifestyle shapes your future.
        <br>
        <br>So keep practising these habits of emotional intelligence. The changes will be gradual, but you'll get there. Your goals will be acheived.
