        <p>
            This week has been intense. The katas have been cranked up several notches in the form of:
            <h5>Tic Tac Toe</h5>
            A simple strategy game where you have a 3 by 3 grid by which alternating players X and O take turns at trying to fill a vertical, horizontal or diagonal row with their move.
            <br>The first one to complete this, is the winner, right? trying to set this up as working code is another story. Getting the cells clickable was quite tricky, then to get the cells to remember what player clicked in there,
            <br> and to display the symbol, stretched my brain to shut down mode. I shall include photos of these soon...
        </p>
        <p>
           <h5>JS carnival</h5>
           Three challenges themed on the carnival side shows. The first being:
           <b>Inflate the unicorn:</b> I know, it sounds weird. This challenge involved three unicorn images in a row and they had no horn, but a balloon you had to inflate by clicking on it three times. Mapping the unicorn images as an array was
           <br> also challenging, but also counting the clicks per unicorn to inflate the balloons ( well, swapping out the multiple balloon images per unicorn) took a lot of thinking through.
        </p>
       <p>
         <b>Whack a mole:<b/> A game where you click on a mole image that shows in a random table cell and respawns in another random cell after you 'whack' it.
         <br>Again, after mapping the cells in the table as an array, then randomising them after making them clickable started to hurt my brain. Then adding the mole image to click on in that random cell, I swear I could smell smoke...
        </p>
       <p>
           <b>Dress the clown:</b> This challenge involved the use of the arrow keys on your keyboard to switch outfits on a cartoon figure, as well as switch body parts to also switch outfits.
           <br>This included the use of keyboard event listeners and key code mapping. It starts off by switching the hats on his head by using the left/right arrow keys, then to change to the body, use the up/down arrow keys, then back to the left/right arrows to change the body outfits.
           <br> finally to his feet, where you can switch the shoes. At first I was highly reluctant to attempt this as this just seemed too hard, but I thought Id better give it a shot anyway..but after watching the follow along video and adding the pseuocode to remind myself just what the heck I had typed,
           <br> It's funny how the brain likes to over complicate things when you start thinking about problems, making it worse than it seems.
       </p>

<h5>Bootcamp</h5>
The next phase of the course where I get with other students to form groups to collaborate on mini projects and to attent classes and lectures on better coding practises and problem solving.
<br> Some part of me wants to get going with the classroom format where I can ask questions and get help with what I'm trying to produce - someone to critique my code right there.
<br> Another part of me is nervous I'm not going to be able able to keep up with the others, holding them back. I'm going to give everything I've got to try and retain the knowledge I've gained so far, and if it all goes pear shaped after it's all finished, then I'll know for sure.
</p>
<p>
<h5>More challenges</h5>
On Saturday, my computer decided it wouldn't recoginise my fingerprint to log in. Thanks to windows bitlocker, I'm locked out of my machine for 30 days. great, just great....
<br> I'm having to type this out on an iPad which makes it cumbersome and slow, and having to type this directly in github, makes it a real pain.
<br> oh well...
