    <h3>HTML and CSS</h3>
    <div class="space">

    <h4>HTML</h4>
    HTML is the backbone to the Structure of Webpages. HTML stands for <b>H</b>yper<b>T</b>ext <b>M</b>arkup <b>L</b>angauge.
    <p>All Webpages are handled as interconnected (linked) documents within a website as well as througout the entire internet.</p>  
    
   <p>It uses a particular scripting language that all browsers can process, format into a hierarchical order based on what elements are within the document, and displays it a way that users can understand.   
    <br>Think of it like a russian doll (a wooden doll, inside a wooden doll, inside a wooden doll) 
    <br>
    <img src="/img/html.png">
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>HTML encapsulates these elements (body, header, dividers, tables, lists, links, images, buttons, forms, paragraphs, footer...) within tags.     
    <br> These tags use the greater than symbol, and the less than symbol. </p>    
    All these tags must have an opening tags (<code>< tag ></code>) and closing tags (<code>< /tag ></code>). If any of these elements dont have either matching tags, HTML leaks out onto the page and displays gibberish.
    <br>

    </p>
    <h4>CSS</h4>

    <p>Now, CSS stands for <b>C</b>ascading <b>S</b>tyle<b>S</b>heets.     
    <br>CSS are the rulesets that dictate the placement and formatting (styling) of said elements within the document, and HTML can have links within HTML documents referrring to CSS files 
    <br>if you needed to upgrade the standard look of pages. Make it pop. 
    <br></p>
    <br><b>What does CSS look like? </b> Here's a screen shot of some CSS in the wild.
    <br>
    <br><img src="/img/css.png" height="400" width="280">
    <br>
    <p>These rules include attribrutes regarding the font and size of text, tables, images, video and links to other documents and its placement within the documents.
    <br>Attributes that are used include: padding, borders, colors, corners, buttons, position, display, margins, float, position, indent, z-index (layering), font-family, height, overflow, transforms... the list is pretty extensive.  
    <br>Each of these attributes implements different characteristics of how the element looks in relation to elements next to it.
    <br>You can really fine tune how your content looks and behaves on the page by using various attributes in the rules for each element.
    <br>Fine tuning can include assigning classes and or ID's to particular elements to differentiate from other elements.  
    <br>For example: <code> .main </code>points to <code> < div class="main"> </code> residing in the hmtl file, and <code> #main </code> points to <code> < div id="main"> </code>
    <p>You can either have CSS in the same page within the <code> < stlyle > </code> section of the page or as a external link. Like this: <code> < link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles/my.css"> </code></p>

   <p>CSS can also have nested elements and nested attributes with each ruleset (hence: the cascading part of it) </p>
   </p>
<br>
    <h4>The Box Model</h4>
    <br>CSS also has a hierarchical order when it comes to the placement of elements. They use what is called: The Box model.
    <br>By default, all your elements (tables, buttons pages, images) come without styling, and look crammed next to each other on the page. 
    <br>This where the box model comes into play.
    <br>Also, think of it like a russian doll. 
    <br>Ok, so from the outside in, the order goes:    
    Margin, Border, Padding, then the content (text or image, or whatever).
    <br>
    <br>
    <img src="/img/box-model.png" id="box-model" height="240" width="450">
    <br>
    <br>

   <p>So, if you use this box model with skill and discernment, your content will look great on the page!!</p>
