        <br><h5>Dev Academy Handbook</h5>
        This week I've been getting more familiar with the Handbook and the implememtation of the course curriculum.
        <br>I'm getting into the flow of it. Finally.
        <br>
        <br><h5>The intro to JavaScript</h5>
        When I first started the JavaScript lessons, I thought I had a reasonable good grasp on the basic concepts of how it all worked, but I found out I was was missing some snippets of understanding how particular components actually worked.
        <br>I was still - shall we say - linguistically incoherant. After sitting at the screen for four minutes thinking to myself: "c'mon Gav, you can add two numbers together, can't you?"
        <br>The light flashed into existence after I put the correct answer in, as a shot in the dark. I laughed for four minutes, because it looked so simple.
        <br>Once I figured out that the console.log() was taking care of the output, all I had to do was focus on the main question and get familiar with how the components actually worked.
        <br>When the questions got tougher, like with the functions with parameters question, I had to ask for help quite a bit, step by step until I got the jist of how they worked, then I surged ahead again.
        <br>I discovered quite a while ago that the only way new information could stick in my head, was to repeat the question or task at least three/four times before it took root.
        <br>These Javascript lessons were no execption. But once the neural pathways had opened up, I was in the flow.
        <br>
        <br>The gameboard exercise was a good experience. I got a good walk through with Johnny on zoom regarding the finer points of targeting classes and displaying the score.
        <br> Just a little bit of prompting and I nailed it. Thanks Johnny.
        <br><h5>The Dom</h5>
        Man, I spent quite a bit of time going over this, and I was adding bits into my JavaScript blog page as to how it all worked.
        <br>I found that while I was adding bits into my page, it was re-enforcing my pre-existing knowledge about this, and adding to it.
        <br>so, the main block of time I spent on this, was refining the page and ensuring the information I learned was accurate.
        <br>It was a good exercise none-the less. I quite liked the video on the passenger counter app. I tried looking for it again on Friday
        <br>But couldn't find it, so I went on youtube and found something similar. I wanted to make sure my syntax was accurate.
        <br>
        <br><h5>Dev Tools</h5>
        This was also great to watch and code along. Traversy Media - I like his style of teaching. I never knew just how much you can tinker with the console like that...
        <br>Impressive.
        <br>
        <br><h5>JavaScipt Cafe</h5>
        oh man, This was fun to put together.
        <br>This was a cool little app where you had a range of products, that had prices and stock numbers, and customers would come and order things like coffee, muffins, eggs.
        <br>So you would click on the button to process the order, and the order would display. You would then click the fill order button and it would show how much the items cost and show how much was made.
        <br>When a product ran out, it would display an alert. Shout out to Joseph. Nice job, putting that video together mate.
        <br>
        <br> I think I'm at the point where I was needing less help with problems understanding how the components worked, and more on the accuracy of the interactions of components.
        <br>On Friday, I posted a help request on discord regarding the cash function on the Cafe app. But within three minutes, I'd discovered what was wrong, and corrected it myself.
        <br>
        <br>It's been a good week...
