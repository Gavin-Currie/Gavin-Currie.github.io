    <h3>JavaScript and the DOM</h3>
    <div class="space">
        <br><h5>JavaScript</h5>
        JavaScript: The engine behind HTML. The scripting language which give your pages more functionality.
        <br>Usually seen in the <code> < script > </script></code> section of your page, or as a link to a seperate file in it's own folder, like this:
        <br><code> < script src="/js/main.js" > </code> 
        <br>Now, this Javascript can hold various information about your elements within the web page.
        <br>Javascipt reads the commands from top to bottom (like us).
        <br>Oh, another thing: Javascript has a reputation for being finnicky with text, so make sure your functions or variables are written in camel case; like this: <b>firstSecondThirdword</b> 
        <br>
        <br><h6>Under the hood:</h6>
        <br>To have a better idea of how Javascript can manage your content, we need to look into the inspection console. 
        <br>This is a portal to the various manangement controls and navigation of the structure of your pages.
        <br>
        <br>To do this, on your web page your veiwing, right click on the page, then click: inspect.
        <br><img src="/img/html-inspect.png">
        <br>
        <br>This will bring up an inspection panel to the right of your browser.
        <br><img src="/img/inspect-console.png">
        <br>
        <br>When you are testing web pages with Javascript, including the line: console.log() as a test output, is a good habit to adopt.
        <br>For example - If you wanted to test output the value of a variable to the console, you would type something like this:
        <br>(where the variable value outputs as the parameter inside the ( ) )
        <br><img src="/img/js-console.png">
        <br>You can also do this with functions, conditionals, arrays, loops and objects.
        <br>
        <br><b>Components:</b> 
        <br>Javascript contains various components with which to operate and manage your data used within your content, such as:
        <br>
        <br><ul>
            <li><b>Comments:</b>Notes used to explain what blocks of code do, it's unseen by the program, and dosent affect the actual code. 
                <br>Written as: 
                <br><img src="/img/js-comment.png"></li>
                <br>
            <li><b>Variables:</b>The basic building blocks of Javascript code. The retainers of data (their values). Value data types include: strings ("hello"), numbers (45), floats (5.67), booleans (true/false).
               <br>Written as: 
               <br><img src="/img/js-variable.png"></li>
               <br>
            <li><b>Functions:</b>Reusable blocks of code that run the program to improve efficiency. 
               <br>Written as: 
               <br><img src="/img/js-function.png"></li>
               <br>
            <li><b>Conditionals:</b>The testing mechanism where you want to check if variables or values equate, or meet certain criteria. 
                <br>Written as: 
                <br><img src="/img/js-conditional.png"></li>
                <br>
            <li><b>Arrays:</b>Used for handling multiple values. 
                <br>Written as:
                <br><img src="/img/js-array.png"></li>
                The inside [x] is a representaion of its position in the array. Arrays start counting at 0.
                <br>
                <br>
            <li><b>Loops:</b>Used for repeating an incrementing value until a certain criteria is met.
                <br>Written as:
                <br><img src="/img/js-loop.png"></li>
                <br>
            <li><b>Objects:</b>Adding an extra dimension to values by giving them properties.
                 
                <br> Written as key/value pairs. Like this: 
                <br><img src="/img/js-object.png"></li>
                An example would be: a key would be colour, and its value would be "blue"
        </ul>
        <br>
        <br><h5>The DOM</h5>
        When they mention The DOM, it refers to the <b>D</b>ocument <b>O</b>bject <b>M</b>odel.
        <br>This how Javascript interacts with your web page.
        <br>
        <br><b>Document:</b> refers to Javascript handling the Web page as an HTML document.
        <br><b>Object:</b> Javascript handles the HTML tags as objects and how the document heirarchy is structured like a 'tree'.
        (See my HTML page) With each nested element, Javascript treats as a child object or branches within that parent object.
        <br><b>Model:</b> This is displayed as a representation of that JavaScript object. This includes:
        <ul>
            <li>The interfaces and objects used to represent and manipulate a document</li>
            <li>The semantics of these interfaces and objects - including both behavior and attributes</li>
            <li>The relationships and collaborations among these interfaces and objects</li>
        </ul> 
        <br><img src="/img/html-dom.png">
        
        <br>
        <br><h6>Interactivity</h6>
        This where the DOM starts to show it's usefulness.
        <br>
        <br>For example: you can have elements assigned with a call (references to) to a function residing in a JavaScript file.
        <br>Like this:
        <br><img src="/img/js-button.png">
        <br>The <b>onClick</b> is a event handler which listens for a mouse click - when clicked, calls the function <b>clickMe()</b>
        <br><img src="/img/js-buttonFunction.png">
        <br>Event handlers also include: onChange, onMouseover, onMouseout, onKeydown, onLoad
        <br>
        <br><h6>Showing results:</h6>
        To take it up a notch, we can display the results of this interactivity as content on the page.
        <br>For example - say we have:
        <ul>
            <li>A button with an id of "increment-btn" </li>
            <li>A button with an id of "save-btn"</li>
            <li>An H2 tag where the increment result is displayed</li>
            <li>And the paragraph tag where the saved counts are displayed</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="/img/js-function-btn.png">
        <br><img src="/img/js-function-tag.png">
        <br>
        <br>Then in the Javascript, it all comes together.
        <br><img src="/img/js-function-js.png">
        <br>What this does is, every time the increment button is clicked, the script tells the increment function to increase the count by one.
        <ul>
            <li>It assigns a <b>count</b> variable and sets it to zero</li>
            <li>It then assigns a variable <b>countEL.</b> which references the HTML <b>document</b>, 
               <br>runs the method that targets the tag within the document by id (<b>.getElementById</b>) - yep, the H2  tag with the id of <b>("count-el")</b> is what is being targeted.</li>
            <li>Then in the increment function, it increases the count by one (<b>count +=1</b>), then spits out the result 
                <br> (the <b>.innerText</b> part is where javascript puts the code into HTML ) back into the H2 tag with the new variable <b>count</b>.
            </li>
            <li>The save button does something similar: it assigns a variable <b>saveEL</b> which the method that targets the <b>("save-el")</b> id, (the paragraph tag)</li>
            <li>Then in the save function, with the variable <b>countStr</b> that saves the current total of the variable <b>count</b>, adds the " - ",
               <br>Then inputs the (<b>countStr</b>) variable into <b>.textContent</b> (the paragraph tag) 
            </li>
            <li>It then resets the program, and the <b>count</b> variable back to zero, while still retaining the saved count total.</li>
        </ul> 

        <br>So, with a bit of CSS styling, hopefully your page will look something like this:
        <br><img src="/img/js-app.png">
        <br>Boy, I hope this makes sense... 
        <br>You can also manipulate other elements and their properites, like: by class, by element type, by tag name, by URL, links, event listeners, forms, active links, whether a button is clicked etc...wow.
