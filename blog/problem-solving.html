    <h3>Problem Solving</h3>
    <div class="space">
       <p>
            Problem solving is an everyday activity. No one can truly escape problems. They come in many forms, big and small.
            Knowing how to solve problems is the key to getting ahead with your day. 
            There are many different techniques to solving problems: some techniques can provide a multitude of solutions, while other techniques are task specific for that problem alone.

            <h5>Being blocked on a simple problem:</h5>
            Initiallly I couldn't get my head around how to use the testing technique used on repl.it. It took quite a while to think backwards in seeing how to solve the problem that way.
            <br>At first I would google how to write the different methods for a javascript object. The theory was there - but google was providing answers for the actual problem, not the testing for it.
            <br>I just wasn't making the transisiton to knowing how to apply this technique to what was required.
            <br> For example, with the fizzbuzz exercise, I would start to get a little frustrated and a little panicky, sensing I was falling behind everyone else, as I would put in some code as to what I thought was the answer, then to split back a error message along with other error messages.

       <p>
            <h5>The time I elegantly solved a problem:</h5>
            The Fizzbuzz problem was a good example. At first I was putting in code for the fizzbuzz problem I had googled. It would actually run the fizzbuzz loop, then have error messages.
            <br>I would start to get a little frustrated at the lack of expected results. After some discussion with a coach (which was a method I used for problem solving) and screensharing on what my approach was to the problem, I quickly realised I had console.log() as my outputs for each if statement instead of return.
            <br>The program then ran as expected according to the testing rules. The sence of relief after changing the console.log() to return statements, was pretty good.

            <h5>The reflection on my confidence on using the following techniques to solve problems:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Pseudocode:</b> I'm quite familiar with this, as this is the tecnical term for adding comments into your code. 
                    <br>It helps me to establish a scope on what the intended actions for the program will be. A guideline on what to include (codewise) for the next few lines.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Trying something:</b> Just have a go. Dont be afraid to screw up. You can always undo. It is all part of learning - trial and error.
                    <br>Have a go first, then refer to documentation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Rubber ducky method:</b> The 'rubber ducky' method is a problem solving technique where you pick an object ( a rubber ducky for example) and explain the problem to them.
                    <br>Often by verbalising  a problem (even to yourself) can help bring clarity for a solution.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Reading error messages:</b> One of the main go-to's in programming. If you get past all the red text, you'll often find big hints on how to solve the errors.
                    <br>They often point out line numbers where the error has occured, then from there, you can deduce the problem.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>console.logging:</b>At first, I would kind of avoid it, but now I find it is a great tool for catching glaring errors you might miss in your code reliability to the console before outputting to the program itself.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Googling:</b>Another popular go-to for finding solutions, but it is so easy to get side tracked and waste time on tech forums. But it is a good lead point for finding out what error messages mean.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Asking peers for help:</b> A great technique for finding solutions particularly when there is a collaege who is working on the same problem, and they can bring another perspective on how to approach and solve that problem.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Asking coaches for help:</b> Often coaches have walked this error path before - many times, and have clarity and the right tools at hand to bring a solution that fits your problem.
                    <br>Offering great advice, and hints on steps on how to solve it.
                </li>
