            <h5>App set up</h5>
            Phew... the first week as been a bit of a mad scramble, getting the cerebral stretch.
            <br>I've completed all the apps and programs intstallation processes last week. It has been a bit nerve racking getting used to using discord and slack. The zoom calls were challenging to get used to. Not sure where all the controls were...
            <br>My desktop monitor is plugged into the laptop, so it gets a bit dis-orienting trying to find the mouse across two screens.

            <h5>Git installation</h5>
            This took a bit of time trying to configure. After installing and initting the repo folder I wanted things in, things went a bit wonky and couldnt figure out why it was playing up in the terminal window in VScode. Configuring the .bashrc file was fun. Got all the prompt variables sorted and it's looking great, and all the aliases pointing in the right direction.
            <br>

       <br>
       <h5>Windows and WSL</h5>
       This took a bit of time trying to configure. Initially I was going to do all the terminal commands in VScode, but the terminal window kept defaulting to powershell - mildly annoying...I would like to learn more about powershell at some stage. At first WSL wouldnt install properly, and I was feeling the pressure to get it done by Saturday, So I tried intsalling ubuntu on vmware workstation, then virualbox, but the virtual screen wouldnt fill the laptop screen. oh, well... 
       I discovered after, after googling how to install WSL the RIGHT way (running command prompt as administrator), it installed first try and is running fine. I've switched to using ubuntu for my git commands, now.

            <h5>Git Hub</h5>
            I haven't used GitHub for ages, and it took me three days to get used to how to type the commands. I had to dig up all my material I had on OneNote regarding Git and GitHub commands to remind myself. I'm revising the diagrams I've Initially drawn up regarding the overall functionality, due to the new understanding of how GitHub works.

            <h5>Toggl</h5>
            Now this interesting...Never used this kind of App before, But I'm getting used to it. It's keeping me disciplined on tracking how much time I spend doing tasks. I quite like the way it keeps a total time acculumlated across your different tasks throughout the day. Nice.

            <h5>Dev Academy Handbook</h5>
            This also, is taking a bit of getting used to, as I've gotten into the habit of reading really fast, skipping details of instructions, going back, and re-reading to correct what glitches and stuff up's I've made.
            <br>yes, Gav ....slow down. You're not at Acme any more.
