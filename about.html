        <p>I am a Storeperson with decades of experience in Warehousing and logisitics, wanting to transisition into the IT industry.</p>
        <p>Well, what sparks the fire in the belly in regards to Technology? I'm fascinated with the idea of innovation and the question of:
            <br> how can we make things more efficient? - if we can imagine it, we can realise it.
            <br>It's also the chance to be digitally creative, working that quirky blend of artist, geek and engineer.
            <br>Also the phrase: 'everything is created twice'.
            <br>This kind of work, suits my aspergic tendencies right to the ground!
        </p>
        <p>I love to think about solutions that make day to day operations more efficient, automating various tasks where possible, and making the work process more ergonomically freindly.
            <br>I'm a very 'hands on, and lets get stuck into it' style of learner, with a constantly curious mind, analysing how a peice of technology might work, and exploring it schematics,
            <br>or the syntax structure of various scripting languages.
        </p>
        <p>One thing I really enjoyed about my Job, is the active participation as part of a team being as efficient and cohesive as possible and getting familiar with the technology they use.
            <br>.. and the occassional dad joke or witty pun.
            <br>..I'm so stoked to have this opportunity to be part of this years intake with Dev Academy - I've waited a long time for this. : )
