**Test Blog**

This my test Blog as I go through The Dev Academy foundations course.    
As I progress through the course, I'll add code and various components to it.    

Watch it slowly evolve.    

As I go, I'll add file details that explains what the code does, and what the various components do.

To have a look at what I've done so far, check out: [https://gavin-currie.github.io/](https://gavin-currie.github.io)
