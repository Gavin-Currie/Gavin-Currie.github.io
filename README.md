**Test Blog**

This my test Blog as I go through The Dev Academy foundations course.    
As I progress through the course, I'll add code and various components to it.   
I'll add a file that explains what the code does, and how the various components do.

To have a look at what I've done so far, check out: [https://gavin-currie.github.io/](https://gavin-currie.github.io)
